		<p>OK, back to the sidebar. The sidebar div has classes of 'span-6' and 'last'. I'm sure you guys have caught on now to how these classes work. This sidebar completes the grid that the main span-17 div began. In case you didn't notice, the 'span-#' class can take any number between 1 and 24, unless you decide to use a bigger grid, in which case the 'span-#' class can take any number so long as the number is less than the total number of columns in your grid. </p>
